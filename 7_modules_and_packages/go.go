// Understanding Modules and Packages in Go

// Packages in Go
// A package in Go is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. Packages are used to organize code, manage dependencies, and reuse functionality across Go applications.

// Visibility of Identifiers
// The visibility of names (identifiers) in Go, such as variables, types, functions, etc., is determined by the first letter of the identifier:
// - Identifiers starting with a Capital Letter are Exported from the package. This means they can be accessed from code in other packages.
// - Identifiers starting with a lowercase letter are not exported and remain internal to the package, accessible only within the same package.

// Best Practices for Package Naming
// - Keep package names short, concise, and descriptive to the functionality they provide.
// - Use simple, lower-case names without underscores or mixedCaps. This convention aids in readability and avoids ambiguity.

// Modules in Go
// A module is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Modules were introduced in Go 1.11 to handle dependency management more effectively.
// - To create a new module, use the `go mod init <module path>` command, which generates a go.mod file. This file defines the module's path and its dependency requirements.
// - The module path typically corresponds to the repository location where your code will be stored, enabling easy version control and package import by other modules.

// Example: Creating a Simple Module
// 1. Initialize a new module: `go mod init example.com/mymodule`
// 2. Add your package directories and Go files within the module directory.
// 3. Use `go build`, `go test`, and other Go commands to develop and manage your module.

// Dependency Management
// - The `go.mod` file tracks your module's dependencies.
// - When you import packages from other modules, the required module versions are added to your `go.mod` file.
// - Use `go get` to update your dependencies to newer minor or patch releases.
// - Run `go mod tidy` to remove unused dependencies from your module.
