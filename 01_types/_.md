# Types

### Compilation

Simply put, when one writes code, the code is read by a program called a compiler. This compiler will rewrite the human readable source code into something that only a machine can read and execute, i.e. machine code. This process is called "compilation".

Each language has its own compilers, each with different design philosophies and rules. Certain compilers are more picky than others. Some need to know everything about the code ahead of time, before executing it...some are ok with figuring things out once it's already executing the code. One of the primary concerns of a compiler are "types".

Programming can be seen as the practice of dealing with data. Data can come in various kinds, like numbers or text. In programming these "kinds" are formally called "types".

Different languages will call the same kind of data by slightly different names, but this is superficial for the most part. For example, one language could call a number "number", and another will call it "integer". Each language follows their own convention, but for the most part share a lot commonalities. In programming, text is often called "string".

Below is an example of creating several pieces of data with their types. You don't need to understand every keyword, just take note of how the type of the data is being explicitly written out.

```typescript
var name: string = "Peter"
var age: number = 21
var human: boolean = true
```

Types in programming languages serve as a foundational concept that underpins the structure and semantics of the code we write. At a high level, types can be understood as a classification system. This classification influences:

- how data is stored in memory and

- what operations on that data are allowed

An invalid operation on differing types would produce a "type error". In some languages `"Peter" + 1` would be a type error, because adding a number and a string normally would'nt mean anything useful, as arithmetic operation are solely the domain of numbers. However, some compilers have different rules and would be perfectly fine with such operation. The formal set of rules governing types in a given compiler is called its "type system".

### Common Type Systems

#### Static vs. Dynamic Typing

- **Static typing** involves explicitly declaring types before compilation, enabling the compiler to catch type errors at compile time. Languages like C, Rust, Go, and TypeScript (when strict typing is enabled) follow this model, which can lead to more predictable code and potentially more efficient execution.
- **Dynamic typing**, seen in languages like Python and JavaScript, allows types to be determined at runtime (during code execution). This offers flexibility and ease of development at the cost of potentially catching type errors only during execution.

#### Primitive and Composite/Complex Types

- **Primitive types** are the basic building blocks of a language's type system. These types are universally found across programming languages, though their implementation and the precision of numerical types can vary. They commonly include "integer"/"number"/"float", "string", and "boolean"/"bool".
- **Composite/Complex types** allow for the construction of more complex data structures that can help use model data more accurately and contain powerful operations. These include arrays, structs, classes, and unions just to name a few.

#### Type Safety and Inference

- **Type safety** refers to how strictly a language enforces rules regarding the manipulation of different types. A language with high type safety will prevent operations that could lead to type errors, such as adding a number to a string without explicit conversion.
- **Type inference** is a feature where the compiler automatically deduces the types of variables based on the context in which they are used. Languages like Rust and TypeScript can infer types, reducing the verbosity of code while maintaining the advantages of static typing.

#### Memory Management

- The type system also influences how a language handles memory management. In statically typed languages like C and Rust, understanding the sizes and lifetimes of different types is crucial for manual memory management and avoiding memory leaks. In contrast, dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript abstract away much of this complexity through automatic memory management and garbage collection.

#### Type Conversion and Coercion

- **Type conversion** (or casting) involves converting a value from one type to another. This can be explicit, as seen in statically typed languages, or implicit, which is more common in dynamically typed languages.
- **Type coercion** is the automatic or implicit conversion of values between types. While this can make certain operations more convenient, it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not well understood.

### Conclusion

Understanding the type systems of different programming languages is crucial for writing effective, efficient, and safe code. The design decisions behind a language's type system, including how it handles typing, composite types, type safety, and memory management, reflect a balance between performance, safety, and developer convenience. By appreciating these nuances, developers can better leverage the strengths of each language and avoid common pitfalls related to type errors and memory management issues.
